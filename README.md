# Predicting a Real Estate Sales Price 

### Project Description

##### I find Real Estate to be quite facinating. People spend large amounts of financial resources to find the one either as a home to live in or as a investment. Either way it's expensive! This project aims to take into consideration all the factors a home buyer or seller would have such as location, time, number of bedrooms or bathrooms and create a prediction on how much this property could sell for. 

##### We started this project by cleaning my data, there was quite a large amount of raw data that was left blank, such as distance to bus stops or walkable score. We cleaned this up by removing as we had a large amount of empty cells. 

##### I then worked on initializing the EDA or exploratory data analysis. I completed this through Tableau where I visualized the location of the different listings, found locations with higher than usual sales price and looked at trends such as number of photos in the lisiting compared to the sales price. 

##### Next the exciting part of machine learning. I used 4 machine learning models to initialize my regression. 
* Linear Regression
* K Nearest Neighbour Regression 
* Gradient Boosting Regression 
* XG Boosting Regression 

### Project Plan 

##### For this project there was a total of 5 files, 4 of these being Jupyter notebooks running through Python and one through Tableau. The order to see these files are as follows. You can find these direct files on this repository. 
* Captsone Preprocessing of data.ipynb
* Capstone Data Clean Up .ipynb
* Capstone Tableau Book 1 - EDA .twb
* Capstone Test 1 .ipynb
* Capstone Test 2.ipynb

### Project resolution 

#### After all the steps in cleaning, and modeling the data, I was able to acheive an R-Squared of 0.86. This means that the model was able to predict a home's selling price within a margin of 14%. The machine learning model that was able to achieve this is the Gradient Boosting model. I have learned that not only running your model takes time but also hyperparametization. Doing so with a plan is more important than throwing all parameters and blindly guessing.
